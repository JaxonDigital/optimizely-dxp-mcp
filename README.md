## ü§î The Problem

**You invested in enterprise DXP, but you're only using 10% of its power.**

You chose Optimizely to deliver exceptional digital experiences, but:
- Your team spends more time on DevOps tasks than building features
- Critical issues hide in logs until customers complain
- Deployments are scary, manual, multi-step processes
- Setting up dev environments takes hours or days
- You can't move fast enough to beat competitors embracing AI

**Meanwhile, AI is revolutionizing how software gets built and managed.** Companies using AI-powered automation are shipping 10x faster, finding issues before customers do, and freeing their teams to focus on innovation.

## ‚ú® The Solution

**Your infinite DevOps workforce - AI that never sleeps, never breaks, always delivers.**

This MCP server transforms your Optimizely DXP into an AI-powered platform that goes far beyond replacing Google searches. Just as Optimizely Opal provides an infinite workforce for marketing, this MCP creates your infinite workforce for DXP operations:

- **AI Specialists** that understand your infrastructure, deployments, and data
- **Intelligent Agents** that handle complex multi-step workflows autonomously
- **24/7 Operations** that scale infinitely without adding headcount
- **Your team** elevated from operators to innovators

Finally get the ROI your DXP investment promised - ship faster, break less, sleep better.

## üöÄ The Transformation

**From DXP operator to digital experience innovator:**

- **Ship 10x faster** - What took hours now takes seconds
- **Zero-downtime deployments** - AI handles the complexity
- **Proactive issue resolution** - Fix problems before customers notice
- **Instant dev environments** - Full production replicas in minutes
- **Competitive advantage** - Move at AI speed while others click through portals
- **Maximum DXP ROI** - Finally use all those powerful features you're paying for

## üîå What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the bridge between AI's intelligence and your DXP's capabilities.

While others use AI just to search documentation or write code snippets, MCP enables something revolutionary: **AI that takes action**. This isn't about better search results - it's about AI that can:

- **Execute** complex operations autonomously
- **Orchestrate** multi-step workflows across environments
- **Monitor** systems and self-heal issues
- **Learn** from your infrastructure to make smarter decisions
- **Scale** infinitely without human bottlenecks

Think of it as evolving from "AI as advisor" to "AI as workforce" - the difference between asking for directions and having a chauffeur.

## üìã System Requirements & Architecture

### What Gets Installed

When you install this MCP server, you get:
- **Node.js package** (~1MB) - The MCP server itself
- **EpiCloud PowerShell Module** (auto-installed on first run) - Official Optimizely tooling
- **No database** - Stateless operation
- **No external dependencies** - Everything runs locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - Required for MCP protocol
- **PowerShell 7+** (macOS/Linux) or **PowerShell 5.1+** (Windows)
  - macOS: `brew install --cask powershell`
  - Windows: Pre-installed
  - Linux: [Install PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)

### Why PowerShell Instead of REST API?

**We use Optimizely's official EpiCloud PowerShell module rather than raw REST APIs because:**

1. **Official Support** - EpiCloud is Optimizely's recommended automation tool
2. **Battle-tested** - Used by thousands of deployments daily
3. **Handles Complexity** - Manages auth, retries, pagination automatically
4. **Always Current** - Optimizely updates it with new features immediately
5. **Better Error Messages** - Human-readable errors vs HTTP status codes
6. **Proven Reliability** - We don't reinvent what Optimizely already perfected

Think of it this way: Would you rather use Optimizely's official tool that they use internally, or rebuild everything from scratch?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Setup

### üìç Configuration Scopes

MCP servers can be configured at different levels:

1. **Project Level** (`.mcp.json` in project root) - Best for project-specific configs
   - Keeps credentials with the project
   - Version controlled (remember to gitignore secrets!)
   - Automatically loads when you open the project

2. **User Level** (Claude's config file) - Best for personal/agency setups
   - Claude Code: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_code_config.json`
   - Claude Desktop: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Available across all projects

3. **System Level** - For shared team environments
   - Configure once for all users
   - Requires admin access

üìñ **More info**: [MCP Configuration Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/configuration)

### üéØ Claude Code (Recommended)

Claude Code has the best MCP support with automatic server management and inline tool results.

**Option 1: Project-Level Config** (`.mcp.json` in your project root)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "id=your-uuid;key=YOUR_KEY;secret=YOUR_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
‚úÖ **Benefits**: Config stays with project, auto-loads when opening project
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Add `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore` if it contains secrets!

**Option 2: User-Level Config** (in Claude's config directory)
Same JSON format as above, but in:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_code_config.json`

‚úÖ **Benefits**: Available across all projects, always uses latest version

**Option 3: Global Install (Faster startup)**
```bash
# First install globally
npm install -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "jaxon-optimizely-dxp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "id=your-uuid;key=YOUR_KEY;secret=YOUR_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Remember to update periodically with `npm update -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp`

### üíª Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop also supports MCP but with a slightly different experience.

**Config Location**: 
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Use the same configuration as Claude Code above. The npx approach is recommended to always get updates.

### ü§ñ Coming Soon: ChatGPT & Others

MCP support is being added to other AI assistants:
- **ChatGPT**: MCP support announced, coming soon
- **Open Source**: Any tool supporting MCP protocol

### üîß Multi-Project Setup

Managing multiple Optimizely projects? Configure them all:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-client1": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT1": "id=uuid1;key=KEY1;secret=SECRET1;default=true",
        "CLIENT2": "id=uuid2;key=KEY2;secret=SECRET2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then use: `"switch to CLIENT2"` to change projects within your session.

### ‚úÖ Verify Your Setup

After configuration, test your connection:

```bash
"test connection"
# Should show: ‚úÖ Connected to Optimizely DXP
#            ‚úÖ Permissions: Integration, Preproduction, Production
#            ‚úÖ Project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

### üöÄ Start Using

```bash
"show me what you can do"              # See all capabilities
"check production status"              # Get started
"export production database"           # Your first real operation
```
