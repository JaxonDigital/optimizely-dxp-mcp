## ü§î The Problem

**You invested in enterprise DXP, but you're only using 10% of its power.**

You chose Optimizely to deliver exceptional digital experiences, but:
- Your team spends more time on DevOps tasks than building features
- Critical issues hide in logs until customers complain
- Deployments are scary, manual, multi-step processes
- Setting up dev environments takes hours or days
- You can't move fast enough to beat competitors embracing AI

**Meanwhile, AI is revolutionizing how software gets built and managed.** Companies using AI-powered automation are shipping 10x faster, finding issues before customers do, and freeing their teams to focus on innovation.

## ‚ú® The Solution

**Your infinite DevOps workforce - AI that never sleeps, never breaks, always delivers.**

This MCP server transforms your Optimizely DXP into an AI-powered platform that goes far beyond replacing Google searches. Just as Optimizely Opal provides an infinite workforce for marketing, this MCP creates your infinite workforce for DXP operations:

- **AI Specialists** that understand your infrastructure, deployments, and data
- **Intelligent Agents** that handle complex multi-step workflows autonomously
- **24/7 Operations** that scale infinitely without adding headcount
- **Your team** elevated from operators to innovators

Finally get the ROI your DXP investment promised - ship faster, break less, sleep better.

## üöÄ The Transformation

**From DXP operator to digital experience innovator:**

- **Ship 10x faster** - What took hours now takes seconds
- **Zero-downtime deployments** - AI handles the complexity
- **Proactive issue resolution** - Fix problems before customers notice
- **Instant dev environments** - Full production replicas in minutes
- **Competitive advantage** - Move at AI speed while others click through portals
- **Maximum DXP ROI** - Finally use all those powerful features you're paying for

## üîå What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the bridge between AI's intelligence and your DXP's capabilities.

While others use AI just to search documentation or write code snippets, MCP enables something revolutionary: **AI that takes action**. This isn't about better search results - it's about AI that can:

- **Execute** complex operations autonomously
- **Orchestrate** multi-step workflows across environments
- **Monitor** systems and self-heal issues
- **Learn** from your infrastructure to make smarter decisions
- **Scale** infinitely without human bottlenecks

Think of it as evolving from "AI as advisor" to "AI as workforce" - the difference between asking for directions and having a chauffeur.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: No Manual Startup Required

**DO NOT run `npm start` or `node index.js` - The MCP is NOT a traditional server!**

### ‚ùå What NOT to Do
- **DO NOT run `npm start`** - The MCP is not a standalone server
- **DO NOT run `node dist/index.js` directly** - Claude handles the execution automatically
- **DO NOT keep a terminal window open** - The MCP runs on-demand
- **DO NOT look for a running process** - It starts and stops as needed

### ‚úÖ How MCP Actually Works
1. **Claude automatically starts the MCP** when you open a conversation
2. **The MCP runs as a subprocess** managed entirely by Claude
3. **It starts and stops automatically** based on your usage
4. **No manual intervention required** - just use Claude normally

### üéØ Correct Installation & Usage
```bash
# ONE-TIME SETUP:
# Option 1: Configure to use npx (always latest)
# Add to Claude's config - no install needed!

# Option 2: Global install for faster startup
npm install -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp

# THEN: Just use Claude! The MCP starts automatically
```

**That's it!** Configure once in Claude's settings, then forget about it. The MCP runs invisibly in the background whenever Claude needs it.

#### What is structuredContent?

Every response includes **two formats**:
1. **Human-readable message** - For AI assistants and Claude Code
2. **Structured data object** - For automation tools and programmatic access

#### Example Response Format

```javascript
{
  content: [{
    type: "text",
    text: "‚úÖ Database Export Complete!\n\nExport ID: abc-123\n..."
  }],
  structuredContent: {
    success: true,
    data: {
      exportId: "abc-123",
      environment: "Production",
      databaseName: "epicms",
      status: "Succeeded",
      downloadUrl: "https://..."
    }
  }
}
```

#### Direct Property Access

**No JSON.parse() needed** - access data directly:

```javascript
// n8n, Zapier, Make
const exportId = {{ $json.structuredContent.data.exportId }}
const status = {{ $json.structuredContent.data.status }}
const downloadUrl = {{ $json.structuredContent.data.downloadUrl }}
```

### üîå n8n Integration with HTTP Transport

**New in v3.42.0**: Native n8n integration using HTTP Streamable transport.

#### Quick Start

Start the MCP server in HTTP mode for n8n:

```bash
DXP_MCP_MODE=http npm start
```

Then configure n8n's MCP Client Tool:
- **Server URL**: `http://localhost:3001/mcp`
- All DXP tools will be automatically discovered

#### Configuration

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Required
export DXP_MCP_MODE=http              # Enable HTTP transport

# Optional
export DXP_MCP_PORT=3001              # Default: 3001
export OPTIMIZELY_PROJECT_ID=your-id  # Your DXP credentials
export OPTIMIZELY_PROJECT_KEY=your-key
export OPTIMIZELY_PROJECT_SECRET=your-secret
```

**Start Server**:
```bash
DXP_MCP_MODE=http npm start
```

#### Transport Modes

- **`stdio` (default)** - For Claude Desktop integration
- **`http`** - For n8n and other automation platforms

Both modes support the same tools and functionality. The HTTP mode enables:
- n8n native MCP Client Tool integration
- Other automation platforms that support HTTP MCP
- Testing with curl/Postman
- Multi-client access

## üìã System Requirements & Architecture

### What Gets Installed

When you install this MCP server, you get:
- **Node.js package** (~1MB) - The MCP server itself
- **Direct REST API client** - Native implementation with HMAC authentication
- **No database** - Stateless operation
- **No external dependencies** - Pure Node.js, works everywhere

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - Required for MCP protocol
- **Optimizely API Credentials** - API Key + Secret from DXP Portal

**‚úÖ No PowerShell Required!** (as of v3.44.0)

### Why Direct REST API?

**We use direct REST API calls with HMAC-SHA256 authentication because:**

1. **Faster** - 3-10x faster than PowerShell-based approach
2. **Simpler** - No PowerShell installation or module dependencies
3. **Cross-platform** - Works identically on Windows, macOS, Linux
4. **Reliable** - Direct HTTPS calls with built-in retry logic
5. **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, faster startup
6. **Official** - Uses the same API that Optimizely's tools use

Starting v3.44.0, all operations use Optimizely's REST API directly - no middleware, no extra layers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Setup

### üìç Configuration Scopes

MCP servers can be configured at different levels:

1. **Project Level** (`.mcp.json` in project root) - Best for project-specific configs
   - Keeps credentials with the project
   - Version controlled (remember to gitignore secrets!)
   - Automatically loads when you open the project

2. **User Level** (Claude's config file) - Best for personal/agency setups
   - Claude Code: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_code_config.json`
   - Claude Desktop: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Available across all projects

3. **System Level** - For shared team environments
   - Configure once for all users
   - Requires admin access

üìñ **More info**: [MCP Configuration Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/configuration)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Breaking Changes**: This project is evolving rapidly to deliver the best AI-powered DXP experience. We prioritize innovation over backward compatibility during this early phase. Always use `@latest` in your npx commands to get the latest features and improvements.

### üéØ Claude Code (Recommended)

Claude Code has the best MCP support with automatic server management and inline tool results.

**Option 1: Project-Level Config** (`.mcp.json` in your project root)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "id=your-uuid;key=YOUR_KEY;secret=YOUR_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
‚úÖ **Benefits**: Config stays with project, auto-loads when opening project
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Add `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore` if it contains secrets!

**Option 2: User-Level Config** (in Claude's config directory)
Same JSON format as above, but in:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_code_config.json`

‚úÖ **Benefits**: Available across all projects, always uses latest version

**Option 3: Global Install (Faster startup)**
```bash
# First install globally
npm install -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "jaxon-optimizely-dxp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "id=your-uuid;key=YOUR_KEY;secret=YOUR_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Remember to update periodically with `npm update -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp`

### üíª Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop also supports MCP but with a slightly different experience.

**Config Location**: 
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Use the same configuration as Claude Code above. The npx approach is recommended to always get updates.

### ü§ñ Coming Soon: ChatGPT & Others

MCP support is being added to other AI assistants:
- **ChatGPT**: MCP support announced, coming soon
- **Open Source**: Any tool supporting MCP protocol

### üîß Multi-Project Setup

Managing multiple Optimizely projects? Configure them all:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-client1": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT1": "id=uuid1;key=KEY1;secret=SECRET1",
        "CLIENT2": "id=uuid2;key=KEY2;secret=SECRET2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Project Management Commands

```bash
# List and switch between projects
"list projects"                # Show all configured projects
"current project"              # Show current active project
"switch to CLIENT2"            # Change active project

# Update project configuration dynamically
"update project with new API key"  # Update credentials
"update project to self-hosted"    # Convert project type
```

**Note**: Project switching is session-based. Your selection persists for the current session only.

### üåê Self-Hosted Azure Storage Support (Non-DXP)

For Optimizely solutions hosted outside of DXP (self-hosted Azure), you can still access blobs, logs, and database backups:

#### Configuration

Use Azure Storage connection strings instead of API keys:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-selfhosted": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=mykey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Finding Your Connection String

1. **Azure Portal**:
   - Navigate to your Storage Account
   - Go to "Access keys" under Security + networking
   - Copy the "Connection string" (not just the key)

2. **Azure CLI**:
   ```bash
   az storage account show-connection-string \
     --name mystorageaccount \
     --resource-group myresourcegroup
   ```

3. **From Application Settings**:
   - Check your app's configuration/appsettings.json
   - Look for `ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage` or similar

#### Supported Operations

Self-hosted projects can:
- ‚úÖ **List containers with friendly names** - See "Console Logs" instead of technical names
- ‚úÖ **Download blobs/media files** - With parallel downloading for speed
- ‚úÖ **Download Application Insights logs** - Console and HTTP logs with preview
- ‚úÖ **Download existing database backups** - From backup containers
- ‚úÖ **Use incremental download features** - Only download new/changed files
- ‚úÖ **Natural language commands** - Use friendly names in all operations
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic project type conversion** - Switch between DXP and self-hosted

Self-hosted projects cannot:
- ‚ùå Start deployments (no DXP API)
- ‚ùå Trigger database exports
- ‚ùå Copy content between environments
- ‚ùå Upload deployment packages

**Tip**: You can dynamically update any project between DXP and self-hosted configurations using `"update project"` commands.

#### Example Commands

```bash
# Natural language - use what you see in container list
"download logs Console Logs"        # Downloads from insights-logs-appserviceconsolelogs  
"download logs HTTP Logs"           # Downloads from insights-logs-appservicehttplogs
"download blobs Media Files"        # Downloads from mysitemedia container
"list storage containers"           # Shows friendly names with download hints
```

### üìÅ Download Path Configuration

Control exactly where your downloads go with our flexible 7-level configuration priority system.

#### Configuration Priority Order (highest to lowest)

   ```bash
   "download logs downloadPath=/custom/path"
   ```

2. **Project compact fields** - In-line configuration with credentials
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "ACME": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz;logPath=/logs/acme;dbPath=/db/acme;blobPath=/media/acme"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Project + Type environment variables** - Most specific env vars
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH_LOGS=/projects/acme/logs
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH_DATABASE=/projects/acme/db
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH_BLOBS=/projects/acme/media
   ```

4. **Project-specific paths** - Per-project default
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH=/projects/acme
   ```

5. **Type-specific global variables** - By download type
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_LOGS=/var/logs
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_DATABASE=/db/backups
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_BLOBS=/media
   ```

6. **Global download path** - Universal fallback
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH=/shared/downloads
   ```

7. **Smart defaults** - Intelligent per-OS defaults
   - macOS: `~/Downloads/optimizely-mcp/`
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\optimizely-mcp\`
   - Linux: `~/downloads/optimizely-mcp/`

#### Folder Structure

Downloads are automatically organized by environment:

#### Configuration Examples

**Example 1: Simple global configuration**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "ACME_CORP": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz",
        "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/shared/optimizely-downloads"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example 2: Project-specific paths**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ACME_CORP": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz",
    "CONTOSO": "id=aaa;key=bbb;secret=ccc",
    "OPTIMIZELY_ACME_CORP_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/projects/acme",
    "OPTIMIZELY_CONTOSO_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/projects/contoso"
  }
}
```

**Example 3: Type-specific paths**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ACME_CORP": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_LOGS": "/var/log/optimizely",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_DATABASE": "/backups/databases",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_BLOBS": "/media/downloads"
  }
}
```

**Example 4: Compact field configuration (inline with credentials)**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ACME": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz;logPath=/custom/logs;dbPath=/custom/db;blobPath=/custom/media"
  }
}
```

**Example 5: Mixed configuration for agencies**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLIENT_A": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz;logPath=/clients/a/logs",
    "CLIENT_B": "id=aaa;key=bbb;secret=ccc",
    "CLIENT_C": "id=111;key=222;secret=333",
    "OPTIMIZELY_CLIENT_B_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/clients/b",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/agency/downloads"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- CLIENT_A uses inline path configuration
- CLIENT_B uses project-specific environment variable
- CLIENT_C falls back to global download path

#### Self-Hosted Projects

Self-hosted projects (using Azure Storage connection strings) always default to a 'production' folder since they don't have DXP's three-environment structure:

```
/downloads/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-self-hosted-project/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production/          # Always 'production' for self-hosted
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ console-logs/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ http-logs/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ application-logs/
```

#### Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables for shared teams** - Keeps paths consistent across team members
2. **Use compact fields for project portability** - Everything in one line
3. **Set type-specific paths for organization** - Logs, databases, and blobs in separate locations
4. **Use downloadPath parameter for one-off downloads** - Override without changing config
5. **Let smart defaults work** - They're designed to be intuitive per-OS

### ‚úÖ Verify Your Setup

After configuration, test your connection:

```bash
"test connection"
# Tests the current active project and shows:
# ‚úÖ Connected to Optimizely DXP (or Self-Hosted)
# ‚úÖ Available capabilities based on your configuration
# ‚úÖ Project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

### üìÅ Generated Files

The MCP server creates certain files during operation. **Do not delete these files** as they are essential for proper functionality:

#### `.mcp-backup-state.json`
Tracks database export operations and enables auto-download functionality:
- **Purpose**: Maintains state of current and recent database exports
- **Location**: Created in your current working directory
- **Contents**: Export IDs, project info, download paths, and monitoring state
- **When created**: During database export operations
- **Why it's needed**: Enables background monitoring, auto-download, and resume capabilities

Example structure:
```json
{
  "currentExport": {
    "exportId": "abc-123-def",
    "projectId": "...",
    "environment": "Production",
    "autoDownload": true,
    "downloadPath": "/path/to/downloads"
  },
  "recentExports": [...]
}
```

**Important**: Without this file, auto-download won't work and you'll lose track of in-progress exports if the process is interrupted.

**Note**: The connection test only validates the current active project. Use `"list projects"` to see all configured projects.

### üöÄ Start Using

```bash
"show me what you can do"              # See all capabilities
"check production status"              # Get started
"export production database"           # Your first real operation
```
