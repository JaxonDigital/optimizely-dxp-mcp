## ü§î The Problem

**You invested in enterprise DXP, but you're only using 10% of its power.**

You chose Optimizely to deliver exceptional digital experiences, but:
- Your team spends more time on DevOps tasks than building features
- Critical issues hide in logs until customers complain
- Deployments are scary, manual, multi-step processes
- Setting up dev environments takes hours or days
- You can't move fast enough to beat competitors embracing AI

**Meanwhile, AI is revolutionizing how software gets built and managed.** Companies using AI-powered automation are shipping 10x faster, finding issues before customers do, and freeing their teams to focus on innovation.

## ‚ú® The Solution

**Your infinite DevOps workforce - AI that never sleeps, never breaks, always delivers.**

This MCP server transforms your Optimizely DXP into an AI-powered platform that goes far beyond replacing Google searches. Just as Optimizely Opal provides an infinite workforce for marketing, this MCP creates your infinite workforce for DXP operations:

- **AI Specialists** that understand your infrastructure, deployments, and data
- **Intelligent Agents** that handle complex multi-step workflows autonomously
- **24/7 Operations** that scale infinitely without adding headcount
- **Your team** elevated from operators to innovators

Finally get the ROI your DXP investment promised - ship faster, break less, sleep better.

## üöÄ The Transformation

**From DXP operator to digital experience innovator:**

- **Ship 10x faster** - What took hours now takes seconds
- **Zero-downtime deployments** - AI handles the complexity
- **Proactive issue resolution** - Fix problems before customers notice
- **Instant dev environments** - Full production replicas in minutes
- **Competitive advantage** - Move at AI speed while others click through portals
- **Maximum DXP ROI** - Finally use all those powerful features you're paying for

## üîå What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the bridge between AI's intelligence and your DXP's capabilities.

While others use AI just to search documentation or write code snippets, MCP enables something revolutionary: **AI that takes action**. This isn't about better search results - it's about AI that can:

- **Execute** complex operations autonomously
- **Orchestrate** multi-step workflows across environments
- **Monitor** systems and self-heal issues
- **Learn** from your infrastructure to make smarter decisions
- **Scale** infinitely without human bottlenecks

Think of it as evolving from "AI as advisor" to "AI as workforce" - the difference between asking for directions and having a chauffeur.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: No Manual Startup Required

**DO NOT run `npm start` or `node index.js` - The MCP is NOT a traditional server!**

### ‚ùå What NOT to Do
- **DO NOT run `npm start`** - The MCP is not a standalone server
- **DO NOT run `node dist/index.js`** - Claude handles the execution automatically
- **DO NOT keep a terminal window open** - The MCP runs on-demand
- **DO NOT look for a running process** - It starts and stops as needed

### ‚úÖ How MCP Actually Works
1. **Claude automatically starts the MCP** when you open a conversation
2. **The MCP runs as a subprocess** managed entirely by Claude
3. **It starts and stops automatically** based on your usage
4. **No manual intervention required** - just use Claude normally

### üéØ Correct Installation & Usage
```bash
# ONE-TIME SETUP:
# Option 1: Configure to use npx (always latest)
# Add to Claude's config - no install needed!

# Option 2: Global install for faster startup
npm install -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp

# THEN: Just use Claude! The MCP starts automatically
```

**That's it!** Configure once in Claude's settings, then forget about it. The MCP runs invisibly in the background whenever Claude needs it.

## üìã System Requirements & Architecture

### What Gets Installed

When you install this MCP server, you get:
- **Node.js package** (~1MB) - The MCP server itself
- **EpiCloud PowerShell Module** (auto-installed on first run) - Official Optimizely tooling
- **No database** - Stateless operation
- **No external dependencies** - Everything runs locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - Required for MCP protocol
- **PowerShell 7+** (macOS/Linux) or **PowerShell 5.1+** (Windows)
  - macOS: `brew install --cask powershell`
  - Windows: Pre-installed
  - Linux: [Install PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)

### Why PowerShell Instead of REST API?

**We use Optimizely's official EpiCloud PowerShell module rather than raw REST APIs because:**

1. **Official Support** - EpiCloud is Optimizely's recommended automation tool
2. **Battle-tested** - Used by thousands of deployments daily
3. **Handles Complexity** - Manages auth, retries, pagination automatically
4. **Always Current** - Optimizely updates it with features immediately
5. **Better Error Messages** - Human-readable errors vs HTTP status codes
6. **Proven Reliability** - We don't reinvent what Optimizely already perfected

Think of it this way: Would you rather use Optimizely's official tool that they use internally, or rebuild everything from scratch?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Setup

### üìç Configuration Scopes

MCP servers can be configured at different levels:

1. **Project Level** (`.mcp.json` in project root) - Best for project-specific configs
   - Keeps credentials with the project
   - Version controlled (remember to gitignore secrets!)
   - Automatically loads when you open the project

2. **User Level** (Claude's config file) - Best for personal/agency setups
   - Claude Code: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_code_config.json`
   - Claude Desktop: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Available across all projects

3. **System Level** - For shared team environments
   - Configure once for all users
   - Requires admin access

üìñ **More info**: [MCP Configuration Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/configuration)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Breaking Changes**: This project is evolving rapidly to deliver the best AI-powered DXP experience. We prioritize innovation over backward compatibility during this early phase. Always use `@latest` in your npx commands to get the latest features and improvements.

### üéØ Claude Code (Recommended)

Claude Code has the best MCP support with automatic server management and inline tool results.

**Option 1: Project-Level Config** (`.mcp.json` in your project root)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "id=your-uuid;key=YOUR_KEY;secret=YOUR_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
‚úÖ **Benefits**: Config stays with project, auto-loads when opening project
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Add `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore` if it contains secrets!

**Option 2: User-Level Config** (in Claude's config directory)
Same JSON format as above, but in:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_code_config.json`

‚úÖ **Benefits**: Available across all projects, always uses latest version

**Option 3: Global Install (Faster startup)**
```bash
# First install globally
npm install -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "jaxon-optimizely-dxp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "id=your-uuid;key=YOUR_KEY;secret=YOUR_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Remember to update periodically with `npm update -g @jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp`

### üíª Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop also supports MCP but with a slightly different experience.

**Config Location**: 
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Use the same configuration as Claude Code above. The npx approach is recommended to always get updates.

### ü§ñ Coming Soon: ChatGPT & Others

MCP support is being added to other AI assistants:
- **ChatGPT**: MCP support announced, coming soon
- **Open Source**: Any tool supporting MCP protocol

### üîß Multi-Project Setup

Managing multiple Optimizely projects? Configure them all:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-client1": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT1": "id=uuid1;key=KEY1;secret=SECRET1",
        "CLIENT2": "id=uuid2;key=KEY2;secret=SECRET2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Project Management Commands

```bash
# List and switch between projects
"list projects"                # Show all configured projects
"current project"              # Show current active project
"switch to CLIENT2"            # Change active project

# Update project configuration dynamically
"update project with new API key"  # Update credentials
"update project to self-hosted"    # Convert project type
```

**Note**: Project switching is session-based. Your selection persists for the current session only.

### üåê Self-Hosted Azure Storage Support (Non-DXP)

For Optimizely solutions hosted outside of DXP (self-hosted Azure), you can still access blobs, logs, and database backups:

#### Configuration

Use Azure Storage connection strings instead of API keys:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-selfhosted": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_NAME": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=mykey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Finding Your Connection String

1. **Azure Portal**:
   - Navigate to your Storage Account
   - Go to "Access keys" under Security + networking
   - Copy the "Connection string" (not just the key)

2. **Azure CLI**:
   ```bash
   az storage account show-connection-string \
     --name mystorageaccount \
     --resource-group myresourcegroup
   ```

3. **From Application Settings**:
   - Check your app's configuration/appsettings.json
   - Look for `ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage` or similar

#### Supported Operations

Self-hosted projects can:
- ‚úÖ **List containers with friendly names** - See "Console Logs" instead of technical names
- ‚úÖ **Download blobs/media files** - With parallel downloading for speed
- ‚úÖ **Download Application Insights logs** - Console and HTTP logs with preview
- ‚úÖ **Download existing database backups** - From backup containers
- ‚úÖ **Use incremental download features** - Only download new/changed files
- ‚úÖ **Natural language commands** - Use friendly names in all operations
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic project type conversion** - Switch between DXP and self-hosted

Self-hosted projects cannot:
- ‚ùå Start deployments (no DXP API)
- ‚ùå Trigger database exports
- ‚ùå Copy content between environments
- ‚ùå Upload deployment packages

**Tip**: You can dynamically update any project between DXP and self-hosted configurations using `"update project"` commands.

#### Example Commands

```bash
# Natural language - use what you see in container list
"download logs Console Logs"        # Downloads from insights-logs-appserviceconsolelogs  
"download logs HTTP Logs"           # Downloads from insights-logs-appservicehttplogs
"download blobs Media Files"        # Downloads from mysitemedia container
"list storage containers"           # Shows friendly names with download hints
```

### üìÅ Download Path Configuration

Control exactly where your downloads go with our flexible 7-level configuration priority system.

#### Configuration Priority Order (highest to lowest)

1. **User-specified path** - Direct parameter in commands
   ```bash
   "download logs downloadPath=/custom/path"
   ```

2. **Project compact fields** - In-line configuration with credentials
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "ACME": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz;logPath=/logs/acme;dbPath=/db/acme;blobPath=/media/acme"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Project + Type environment variables** - Most specific env vars
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH_LOGS=/projects/acme/logs
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH_DATABASE=/projects/acme/db
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH_BLOBS=/projects/acme/media
   ```

4. **Project-specific paths** - Per-project default
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_ACME_DOWNLOAD_PATH=/projects/acme
   ```

5. **Type-specific global variables** - By download type
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_LOGS=/var/logs
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_DATABASE=/db/backups
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_BLOBS=/media
   ```

6. **Global download path** - Universal fallback
   ```bash
   OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH=/shared/downloads
   ```

7. **Smart defaults** - Intelligent per-OS defaults
   - macOS: `~/Downloads/optimizely-mcp/`
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\optimizely-mcp\`
   - Linux: `~/downloads/optimizely-mcp/`

#### Folder Structure

Downloads are automatically organized by environment:

```
/downloads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [project-name]/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ azure-web-logs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ azure-application-logs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cloudflare-logs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preproduction/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [self-hosted-project]/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production/           # Self-hosted always uses 'production'
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [project-name]/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preproduction/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blobs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [project-name]/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preproduction/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/
```

#### Configuration Examples

**Example 1: Simple global configuration**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optimizely-dxp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaxon-digital/optimizely-dxp-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "ACME_CORP": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz",
        "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/shared/optimizely-downloads"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example 2: Project-specific paths**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ACME_CORP": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz",
    "CONTOSO": "id=aaa;key=bbb;secret=ccc",
    "OPTIMIZELY_ACME_CORP_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/projects/acme",
    "OPTIMIZELY_CONTOSO_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/projects/contoso"
  }
}
```

**Example 3: Type-specific paths**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ACME_CORP": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_LOGS": "/var/log/optimizely",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_DATABASE": "/backups/databases",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH_BLOBS": "/media/downloads"
  }
}
```

**Example 4: Compact field configuration (inline with credentials)**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ACME": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz;logPath=/custom/logs;dbPath=/custom/db;blobPath=/custom/media"
  }
}
```

**Example 5: Mixed configuration for agencies**
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLIENT_A": "id=xxx;key=yyy;secret=zzz;logPath=/clients/a/logs",
    "CLIENT_B": "id=aaa;key=bbb;secret=ccc",
    "CLIENT_C": "id=111;key=222;secret=333",
    "OPTIMIZELY_CLIENT_B_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/clients/b",
    "OPTIMIZELY_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/agency/downloads"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- CLIENT_A uses inline path configuration
- CLIENT_B uses project-specific environment variable
- CLIENT_C falls back to global download path

#### Self-Hosted Projects

Self-hosted projects (using Azure Storage connection strings) always default to a 'production' folder since they don't have DXP's three-environment structure:

```
/downloads/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-self-hosted-project/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production/          # Always 'production' for self-hosted
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ console-logs/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ http-logs/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ application-logs/
```

#### Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables for shared teams** - Keeps paths consistent across team members
2. **Use compact fields for project portability** - Everything in one line
3. **Set type-specific paths for organization** - Logs, databases, and blobs in separate locations
4. **Use downloadPath parameter for one-off downloads** - Override without changing config
5. **Let smart defaults work** - They're designed to be intuitive per-OS

### ‚úÖ Verify Your Setup

After configuration, test your connection:

```bash
"test connection"
# Tests the current active project and shows:
# ‚úÖ Connected to Optimizely DXP (or Self-Hosted)
# ‚úÖ Available capabilities based on your configuration
# ‚úÖ Project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

**Note**: The connection test only validates the current active project. Use `"list projects"` to see all configured projects.

### üöÄ Start Using

```bash
"show me what you can do"              # See all capabilities
"check production status"              # Get started
"export production database"           # Your first real operation
```

We built this tool because we were tired of watching talented teams waste their potential on repetitive tasks. We've been in the trenches with Optimizely DXP for years, and we know every pain point you're facing.

But here's what most people don't realize: **The companies winning in 2025 aren't just using AI - they're transforming their entire digital operations with it.**

### What We Really Do

While this MCP handles your DevOps, we're helping companies:

- **Build AI-powered experiences** that convert 3x better
- **Automate entire workflows** - not just deployments, but content creation, personalization, testing
- **Create intelligent agents** that monitor, optimize, and scale your digital presence 24/7
- **Integrate AI tools** that multiply your team's output by 10x
- **Transform your team** from operators to innovators

### The Opportunity You're Missing

Every day you wait, your competitors are:
- Shipping features 10x faster with AI automation
- Creating personalized experiences at scale
- Reducing operational costs by 70%
- Maximizing the value of your DXP investment

**The question isn't whether AI will transform your digital operations. It's whether you'll lead that transformation or get left behind.**
