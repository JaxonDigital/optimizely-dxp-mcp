## [3.14.3] - 2025-08-30

### Removed
- **Tool Architecture Consolidation**: Major cleanup of redundant and thin-wrapper tools
  - Removed AI-friendly tools (5 thin wrapper functions that reduced transparency)
  - Removed legacy backup aliases (`backup`, `backup_status`, `list_backups`) - use `export_database`, `check_export_status`, `list_exports` instead
  - Consolidated 6 permission checker tools into unified `PermissionChecker` class
  - Merged `database-tools.js` into `database-simple-tools.js` for cleaner architecture

### Improved
- **Unified Permission Detection**: Single, comprehensive permission checker with direct PowerShell execution
- **Streamlined Database Operations**: Consolidated database functionality with internal method implementations

  - Stuck deployment detection (warns when deployments run >20 minutes)
  - Enhanced error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
- **Natural Language Database Operations**: Simple commands for database backups
  - `backup` - Create database backup (defaults to production for safety)
  - `backup_status` - Check backup status (automatically finds latest)
