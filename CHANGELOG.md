and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **DXP-77: Tool Description Cleanup**: Optimized all 45 tool descriptions for token efficiency
  - Removed AI instructions from descriptions (moved to system prompts/documentation)
  - Removed verbose "returns structured data: ..." listings (kept concise param hints)
  - Removed debug markers (HIJACKED, TESTING, etc.)
  - Standardized format: [emoji] [verb] [object] ([key params])
  - **Bundle size reduction**: 153.4kb ‚Üí 150.6kb (2.8kb saved)
  - **Token savings**: ~390 tokens per conversation (average 35 chars saved per tool √ó 45 tools)
  - Examples:
    - Before: `'download_logs': 'üìä Download logs (AI: PROACTIVELY call get_ai_guidance BEFORE using this tool - returns structured data: environment, logType, container, downloadPath, counts, size)'`
    - After: `'download_logs': 'üìä Download logs from environment (dateFilter, logType)'`

### Added
- **Complete structuredContent Support (DXP-66 Extension)**: Added native MCP structuredContent to ALL automation tools
  - **New Tools with structuredContent** (15 additional tools):
    - `export_database` - Export ID, environment, database name, status, download URL, monitoring
    - `check_export_status` - Export status, progress, download URL, auto-download flag
    - `check_download_status` - Download ID, type, status, progress, speed, ETA, file path
    - `download_database_export` - Download ID, file path, size, status, type
    - `download_logs` - Environment, log type, container, download path, counts, size, sparse logging flag
    - `download_blobs` - Container, environment, download path, counts, size, files list
    - `get_download_status` - Download ID, type, status, progress, metadata (supports both log and database downloads)
    - `list_active_downloads` - Total downloads, database downloads array, log downloads array with progress
    - `list_projects` - Total projects, project array with type, credentials, paths, last used
    - `get_version` - Current version, update availability, latest version, system info
    - `list_storage_containers` - Environment, container count, container names array
    - `generate_storage_sas_link` - Container, environment, permissions, expiry, SAS URL
    - `copy_content` - Deployment ID, source/target environments, type, status, includes flags
    - `health_check` - Status, checks object (PowerShell, EpiCloud, credentials, connection), environment access
  - **Already Supported** (from v3.35.0 - 7 tools):
    - test_connection, list_deployments, start_deployment, monitor_deployment, complete_deployment, get_deployment_status, reset_deployment
  - **Coverage**: 22 tools now support automation workflows (n8n, Zapier, Make, etc.)
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Direct property access**: `response.structuredContent.data.exportId` - no JSON.parse() needed
    - **Consistent format** across all major operations (database, logs, blobs, deployments, downloads)
    - **Dual audience**: Human-readable message for AI assistants PLUS structured data for automation
    - **Download management**: Full coverage for background downloads with progress tracking
    - **Project management**: Complete project configuration and version info
    - **Health monitoring**: System status and connection checks with detailed breakdown
  - **Implementation Pattern**:
    - Tool formatters return `{data, message}` format
    - Handlers use `ResponseBuilder.successWithStructuredData(data, message)` when structured format detected
    - src/index.js automatically adds structuredContent field to MCP response
    - Maintains backward compatibility with string-only responses

- **Deployment Progress Logging**: Added -ShowProgress switch to all Start-EpiDeployment calls
  - Enables detailed progress logging during deployment (::PROGRESS::, Information messages)
  - Progress output goes to PowerShell verbose/information streams
  - Applied to both code deployments (deployment-actions.js) and content deployments (content-tools.js)

### Improved
- **Deployment Error/Warning Display**: Enhanced deployment status to show errors and warnings
  - deploymentErrors and deploymentWarnings arrays now displayed in formatted output
  - Already implemented in formatSingleDeployment (deployment-formatters.js:379-393)
  - Helps users see issues without needing to check DXP Portal

- **Cleaner structuredContent Format (DXP-66 Follow-up)**: Removed duplicate message field
  - **Issue**: Message was being returned twice - in `content[0].text` AND in `structuredContent.message`
  - **Solution**: Removed `message` from `structuredContent` object to reduce duplication
  - **Impact**: Cleaner response format, smaller payload size
  - **Breaking Change**: None - automation tools should only access `structuredContent.data` fields
  - **New Format**:
    ```javascript
    {
      content: [{ text: "Human message for AI" }],
      structuredContent: {
        success: true,
        data: { deploymentId: "...", status: "..." }
        // No message field - it's already in content[0].text
      }
    }
    ```

### Fixed
- **Structured Response Format (DXP-66 Complete Fix)**: All critical tools now use native MCP structuredContent field
  - **Issue**: v3.34.1 only had structuredContent logic in src/index.js, but ResponseBuilder was still JSON.stringify-ing
  - **Root Cause**: ResponseBuilder.successWithStructuredData() was wrapping data in old nested format
  - **Solution**: Updated ResponseBuilder to return flat `{data, message}` format that src/index.js expects
  - **Impact**: ALL 6 critical workflow tools now properly expose structuredContent field
    - test_connection (connection status, environment access, capabilities)
    - list_deployments (deployment list with metadata)
    - start_deployment (deployment ID, status, preview URL)
    - monitor_deployment (deployment progress, ETA)
    - complete_deployment (completion status, verification)
    - get_deployment_status (current status, progress percentage)
  - **Benefits**:
    - Automation tools (n8n, Zapier) can access data directly: `response.structuredContent.data.deploymentId`
    - NO JSON.parse() needed - data is already structured
    - AI assistants still get human-readable message in `content[0].text`
    - One response serves both audiences natively
  - **Implementation**:
    - src/index.js:1758-1798 - response formatting with structuredContent support
    - lib/response-builder.js:31-38 - updated successWithStructuredData() to return flat format
    - lib/tools/deployment/deployment-formatters.js:66-232 - formatDeploymentList returns {data, message}
    - lib/tools/deployment/deployment-list.js:15-39 - handleListDeployments uses successWithStructuredData
    - lib/tools/connection-test-tools.js:21-195 - testConnection returns {data, message}
  - **MCP Protocol**: Leverages official structuredContent field from @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

- **PowerShell Error Detection (DXP-72)**: Fixed success:true being returned for actual failures
  - Root cause: PowerShell execution caught errors and enhanced error messages, but success check happened after enhancement
  - Enhanced error messages (with ‚ùå emoji) didn't contain keywords 'error' or 'Exception', so were marked as success
  - Added hasError flag to track if exception was caught in try/catch block
  - Success now requires: no exception caught AND no stderr with error indicators (error/Exception/‚ùå)
  - Fixed in executeEpiCommand (powershell-helper.js:236) and executeEpiCommandDirect (powershell-helper.js:323)
  - Prevents false positives like "EpiCloud module not installed" being reported as success
  - Ensures tools return success:false when operations actually fail

- **Complete/Reset Deployment Monitoring (DXP-71)**: Fixed premature "complete" messages for transitional states
  - complete_deployment now recognizes "Completing" status as transitional, not final
  - reset_deployment now recognizes "Resetting" status as transitional, not final
  - Both operations now provide transparent monitoring instructions when in transitional states
  - AI receives clear instructions to monitor until deployment reaches final state (Succeeded/Reset/Failed)
  - Prevents contradictory messages like "deployment complete" when status shows "Completing"
  - Updated formatDeploymentCompleted, formatDeploymentReset, generateMonitoringInstructions, and handleMonitorDeployment
  - Completion/reset typically takes 2-15 minutes (shown in monitoring instructions)

- **Deployment Timing Expectations**: Updated AI guidance for more realistic deployment durations
  - Changed full deployment estimate from "5-15 minutes" to "30-90 minutes depending on complexity"
  - Changed completion phase from "30-120 seconds" to "2-15 minutes"
  - Added explicit instruction to be patient and not raise concerns unless stuck for several hours
  - Prevents AI from getting worried too quickly during normal long-running deployments
  - Updated in monitor_deployment tool, generateMonitoringInstructions, formatDeploymentCompleted, and config tips

- **UUID Display Truncation**: Fixed deployment/export IDs appearing cut off at first dash
  - Changed substring(0, 8) to substring(0, 13) for better visual clarity
  - Before: "c88fa98f..." (looks cut off at dash)
  - After: "c88fa98f-9d3c..." (clearly intentional truncation)
  - Affects deployment dashboard, export monitoring, and list monitors tools

- **Deployment Monitoring (DXP-70)**: Fixed deployment monitoring not following through on promises
  - Claude Desktop was offering to monitor deployments but never actually polling for updates
  - Implemented transparent monitoring pattern similar to database export monitoring
  - Added waitBeforeCheck and monitor parameters to get_deployment_status tool
  - get_deployment_status now supports wait-then-check pattern with clear AI instructions
  - monitor_deployment now returns actionable monitoring instructions instead of empty promises
  - AI now receives explicit instructions on what tool to call next and with what parameters
  - User sees each status check happen transparently (no hidden background polling)
  - Monitoring stops automatically when deployment reaches terminal state

- **Database Export Monitoring (DXP-64)**: Fixed monitor=false parameter being ignored
  - MCP prompt arguments are passed as strings, causing "false" string to be truthy
  - Added parseBoolean() helper to properly convert string values to booleans
  - monitor="false" now correctly disables automatic monitoring
  - Affects export-database prompt in Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

- **Download Status Tracking (DXP-65)**: Fixed "download not found" error for database exports
  - Root cause: Two separate download tracking systems (logs vs database exports)
  - get_download_status now checks both downloadManager and DatabaseSimpleTools
  - list_active_downloads now shows both log downloads and database exports
  - download_history now includes both download types
  - Race condition eliminated - database export downloads immediately visible

- **Export Time Reporting**: Now shows actual export duration instead of total time since user request
  - parseExportStatus now extracts startTime and completedAt from API response
  - Completed exports show actual export time (e.g., "7m (actual export time)")
  - In-progress exports show time since export started, not since user request
  - More accurate timing when monitoring is disabled and user waits to check status

### Improved
- **User-Facing Text**: Removed "Azure" references - now shows "Optimizely DXP" consistently
  - Retention message now says "how long export remains available" instead of "how long Azure keeps export available"

## [3.44.0] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- **n8n MCP Client Compatibility (DXP-100)**: Added lenient Accept header mode for n8n MCP Client Tool v1.114.4+
  - **Issue**: n8n's MCP Client Tool doesn't send required `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` headers per MCP spec
  - **Impact**: n8n workflows couldn't connect to DXP MCP HTTP server (HTTP 406 errors)
  - **Solution**: Patched MCP SDK to add optional `strictHeaders` parameter
    - Defaults to `true` (spec-compliant) for backward compatibility
    - When `false`, skips Accept header validation in HTTP POST requests
    - Enables n8n workflows while maintaining spec compliance for standard clients
  - **Implementation**:
    - Created automatic SDK patcher (`scripts/patch-mcp-sdk.js`)
    - Patches both ESM and CJS versions of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` after npm install
    - DXP MCP HTTP server uses `strictHeaders: false` in transport options
    - Idempotent patching system (safe to run multiple times)
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `src/index.js` - Enable lenient headers for n8n compatibility
    - `scripts/patch-mcp-sdk.js` - Automatic SDK patcher
    - `package.json` - Added postinstall script to apply patches
    - `N8N_INTEGRATION.md` - Updated troubleshooting section
  - **Testing**: Build successful, HTTP server initializes with patched SDK
  - **Related**: n8n issue #18938, blocks AI orchestration workflows (AA-2)
