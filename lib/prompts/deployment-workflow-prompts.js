[After starting deployment]

‚úÖ **Deployment Started Successfully!**

The deployment is now in progress. I have several monitoring options for you:

## üìä **Monitoring Options:**

### Option 1: Continuous Monitoring (Recommended)
I'll use the \`monitor_deployment\` tool to automatically check the progress every 30 seconds and notify you of important status changes.

### Option 2: Manual Status Checks
You can check the status anytime by asking me, and I'll use \`get_deployment_status\`.

### Option 3: One-time Check
I'll check once now and you can ask me to check again whenever you'd like.

**Which monitoring approach would you prefer?**

üí° **Note:** I'll use the proper MCP monitoring tools instead of bash loops - this is more efficient and provides better progress tracking.`

## üîÑ **Continuous Monitoring Active**

**Deployment ID:** ${deploymentId || '[deployment-id]'}
**Target:** ${targetEnvironment}
**Check Interval:** Every 30 seconds
**Max Duration:** 30 minutes

I'm now monitoring your deployment in the background. Here's what I'll do:

1. **Check progress** every 30 seconds automatically
2. **Alert you** when the deployment reaches key milestones:
   - 25% complete
   - 50% complete
   - 75% complete
   - Verification state (needs your review)
   - Completed

3. **Handle issues** - If any errors occur, I'll notify you immediately

**Current Status:** Checking now...

[Use \`monitor_deployment\` with deploymentId]

You can:
- Ask "what's the status?" anytime for an immediate update
- Say "stop monitoring" if you want to handle it manually
- The monitoring will automatically stop after 30 minutes or when deployment completes

I'll keep you updated on the progress! üöÄ`

Your deployment to ${targetEnvironment} has completed the deployment phase and is now ready for your verification.

**Status:** Awaiting Verification (100% deployed)
**Deployment ID:** ${deploymentId || '[deployment-id]'}

### üîç **Verification Steps:**

1. **Review the changes** at the verification URLs
2. **Test critical functionality** to ensure everything works
3. **Check for any visual or functional issues**

### üìù **Next Actions:**

Once you've verified everything looks good, you have two options:

- **Complete the deployment:** Say "complete deployment" or "looks good, complete it"
- **Rollback if issues found:** Say "rollback" or "reset deployment"

**Note:** The deployment will remain in verification state until you explicitly complete or reset it. There's no automatic timeout.

Have you had a chance to review the verification URLs? Let me know when you're ready to proceed!`

The deployment has encountered an issue that needs your attention.

**Deployment ID:** ${deploymentId || '[deployment-id]'}

### üîß **Recommended Actions:**

1. **Check detailed status:** Let me get the full deployment status to understand the issue
   - I'll use \`get_deployment_status\` to get complete details

2. **Review logs:** Check deployment logs for specific error messages

3. **Common resolutions:**
   - **Timeout issues:** May need to retry the deployment
   - **Permission errors:** Verify environment access
   - **Package issues:** Check if the deployment package is valid

4. **Recovery options:**
   - **Reset deployment:** Use \`reset_deployment\` to rollback
   - **Retry:** Start a new deployment after addressing the issue

Would you like me to get the detailed status to diagnose the issue?`
